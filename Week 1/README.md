## Welcome to Week 1
We're excited to begin this journey into the world of Machine Learning with you. This week, we'll start by building a strong foundation with some essential tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and SciKit Learn - key libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

Following this, we'll explore the fundamentals of Regular Expressions (Regex) and gain a high-level understanding of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline.

1. **[ML Libraries/Python Modules](./Python%20Modules):** We'll start with the Python modules of Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciKit Learn. These modules will facilitate efficient data manipulation and data visualization which is essential for any machine learning task.
2. **[Regular Expression (Regex)](./Regular%20Expression):** Then, we will continue by introducing the **re** Python module. This module plays a vital role in NLP by enabling efficient pattern matching and text preprocessing.
3. **[Intoduction to NLP Pipeline](./NLP%20Pipeline):** To conclude the week, we’ll introduce the Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline - a structured sequence of steps used to process and analyze human language data.
4. **[Assignment](Assignment1.pdf):** It's time to put our knowledge to the test. Let's tackle the assignments and practice our skills to reinforce our understanding.


>[!Note]
For submitting all asignments make a github repo and store the assignments in that repo.
Refer to the [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQsJR8ci3J0) for making repo.
